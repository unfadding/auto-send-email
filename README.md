# auto-send-email
Python backend automation to fetch and send e-mails, inspired in the feeling of wishing to congratulate multiple people from my mail list.

## Running

First of all, you'll need to set your e-mail, password, server and image url that you would like to send. Then, you must run
```
python send_email.py
```
